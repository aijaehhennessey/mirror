  <h1> I think the internet has made us simultaneously very comfortable and very uncomfortable with the concept of being known or seen as vulnerable individuals.
  <p>
   We are able to curate our presentations of self in how we curate our internet and social media presence and the details we choose or relationships we pursue.
   <p>
  Sometimes the concept of being vulnerable to new people makes me feel like a clown. Acknowledging this simple fact is fun and given the amount of memes conveying this sentiment , it isn't just a me thing.
  <p>
   For this reason , I chose to create a simple reflection of our most-loving clown selves,just to see that characteristic reflected back physically. By acknowledging our
   occasional clown behavior , hopefully, we are able to learn from it.
